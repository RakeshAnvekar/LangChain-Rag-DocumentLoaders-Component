LangChain is a framework designed to help developers build applications
powered by large language models (LLMs).

It provides modular components such as document loaders, text splitters,
prompt templates, chains, and agents.

This text file is used for testing the TextLoader functionality in Python.
The loader reads the content and converts it into Document objects.

Key use cases include:
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots
- Document summarization
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Random notes:
Today the system processed 1,245 records successfully.
Error rate was below 0.02 percent.
Next deployment is scheduled for Friday at 10:00 AM.
